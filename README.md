## Installation

  A user simply needs to download the source code from the Github page and have node.js installed as well. Then they should node install inquierer to run the prompts through the terminal.

## Usage

The use for README-Generator is so developers can save time on writing a well-formatted readme with minimal setup. After installation, a user needs to open up their terminal and run 'node index.js', which will begin the prompts.

## Contributions

I did, wiht the help of inquierer and shields.io.

## Testing

I tested this project through trial and error, crafting the questions then working through the logic to append them to the generatemarkdown file. Then it was more trial and error for the markdown formatting.
